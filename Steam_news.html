<h2>Water exists on sunny parts of the moon, scientists confirm</h2>
<p class="date">10/26/2020</p>
<article>
<p>Past observations have suggested that there’s water on the moon. New telescope observations conclude that those findings hold water.</p>

<p>Spacecraft have seen evidence of water ice in permanently shadowed craters at the lunar poles, as well as hints of water molecules on the sunlit surface. But water sightings in sunlit regions have relied on detection of infrared light at a wavelength that could also be emitted by other hydroxyl compounds, which contain hydrogen and oxygen. </p>

<p>Now, the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, or SOFIA, has detected an infrared signal unique to water near the lunar south pole, researchers report online October 26 in Nature Astronomy. “This is the first unambiguous detection of molecular water on the sunlit moon,” says study coauthor Casey Honniball, a lunar scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. “This shows that water is not just in the permanently shadowed regions — that there are other places on the moon that we could potentially find it.”</p>

<h3>Scientists Learn Secrets of Uncrushable Beetle</h3>
<p>For years, scientists have been studying an incredibly tough beetle that lives on the west coast of the United States. The beetle is built so strongly that it's almost impossible to crush. Now scientists think they know why.</p>

<h3>Scientists Working To Save Arctic Ice Cap</h3>
<p>A team of scientists has come up with a plan they say could help rebuild the Arctic ice cap. The ice cap is a huge area of sea ice that covers most of the Arctic Ocean all year round.
